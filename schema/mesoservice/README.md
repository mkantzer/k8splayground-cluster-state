# Mesoservice Schema

This directory contains an application-owner-facing abstraction for defining an application's runtime configuration.
The intention is to provide a simple, minimal schema, which can be inflated into a full suite of Kubernetes manifests.
This will enable app teams to receive a full set of platform features and best practices, without needing to be concerned with specific implementation details.
